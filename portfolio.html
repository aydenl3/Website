differing turtle motion
 and colors. In this game,
 the player controls the gorilla, and controls him with the Up
 and Down arrow keys. Cacti move toward the gorilla, and the
 play will attempt to dodge them. 
After being hit three times, the program will end.</h1>

 player explores a dungeon, going to deeper floors, attempting to beat all the monsters that

 As you proceed through each floor, the monsters get harder, progressing from slimes to skeletons, to a boss. </h1>

    <h1>  Rover Project: This project was to figure out which 
enviroment the rover was located in, based
on the four elements the robot could sense:
Light, Sound, Wind, and Temperature. 
The data suggests that the environment the robot
landed in was one of a Rocky Mountain.
Due to the way in which the blue graph shoots up,
but is interrupted briefly, there is no explanation
for this irregularity except for a thunderstorm for
sound. or cloud coverage for light. Due to the way
in which the interruption does not halt the
increase, it is unlikely that it is a thunderstorm,
and more probable that it is instead a cloud which
briefly covered the robot's sensor. Every other data set
matches up too. Wind is yellow, as it is the only
data set that can be reasonably negative. Temperature is
cyclical, and increases and decreases throughout the day.
Sound checks out too, in that it has stutters, and snaps
above ambient sounds for the wind.
